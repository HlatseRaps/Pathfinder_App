            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                In many rural areas, young people have the talent, drive, and potential to thrive but often lack access to meaningful career opportunities. Employers struggle to find candidates who are both skilled and culturally aligned. Tourists seek authentic experiences but often don’t know where to find them. PathFinder was created to solve these challenges by connecting all three groups in a seamless ecosystem. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our journey began with a simple idea: what if technology could empower young people, help employers find the right talent, and enhance tourism while preserving cultural heritage? Through collaboration with educators, hospitality professionals, and cultural custodians, PathFinder evolved into a platform that combines AI-driven aptitude testing, skills matching, and cultural preservation—all in one easy-to-use interface.

            <p>
                Beyond finding jobs, PathFinder allows you to showcase your skills through video portfolios, gain mentorship, and connect with local employers directly. We aim to empower youth to not just find work but find opportunities where they can grow, thrive, and contribute meaningfully to their communities.
